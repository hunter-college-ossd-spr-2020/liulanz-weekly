On **April 20, 2020**, we had our third guest speaker, :star:**Vicky Brasseur**:star:. She is the author of the book, *Forge Your Future with Open Source*. During her presentation, she shared a couple of people's stories of their experiences after participating in various open source communities. Since I have not yet been into a disrespectful or unhealthy FOSS community, I was shocked when I saw these two comments: "***There were o docs for how to use it and they told me just to read the code***"and "***I asked them to use my correct name then they spent the next several dozen mailing list messages debating whether my asking that was rude. Butâ€¦it's my name.***" :frowning: In the beginning, I thought FOSS is for developers only because it required some basic coding background. Before I take this class, I didn't know what open source software is and didn't know what does it meant by open. I changed my mind after Vicky told us that FOSS should be appliable for everyone and meets the needs of normal people. Lastly, the most important thing that I learned from her is open source is a developed model other than a business model.

It was great that the government took initiative in open source to promote code reuse and decrease code spend while increasing code quality. I like the part where they categorized the open tasks by skill level. This way people can easily find the task that fits them the most. I noticed that some of the open tasks had been solved, but the issues on GitHub remained open. For example, [Footer Email Reference #235](https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil/issues/235) had been resolved by a merged PR on November 2019, and it stays open. One of the good first issues that I looked at is [Reduce Image Sizes](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/issues/87). I was surprised that this issue was opened in 2018, and only until this month, someone took a lead and opened a [PR](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/pull/365). Overall, the community is small and it's not active. For the project, [Code-gov-front](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-front-end/pulls), I noticed that it can take up to 20 to 30 days for a core contributor to review the PR and give feedback on it. :no_mouth: Also, most of the closed PRs were done by the core contributors.

As I was skimming through the issue tracker, I noticed that most of them had to do with incorrect data. However, one of the issues grabbed my attention, and it's called [THANK YOU #2206](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/2206). The person who opened this issue wanted to thank the team at Johns Hopkins for putting this dataset together. I found that very touching. Under the README, there are data sources, if I have time I would contribute to this project. There are still **200+** opened PRs waiting to be reviewed and merged. Before I contribute, I should check if someone has already made a PR.
