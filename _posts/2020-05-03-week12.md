## :pushpin: [Musings on business models for open source software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html)
---

I agree with what Tom Callary says about the users of the proprietary software that might be stuck on a software that doesn't entirely meet their needs, which means that they might be paying for something that's not worth its value. I noticed that in his article, he mentions "Open Core", where the proprietary software builds on top of open core. The core base is open source, but the main product offering in the space adds proprietary software, which was also explained by Vicky Brasseur during her presentation. Lastly, it was a very interesting point that Tom Callaway made about the customers of entirely open source offerings are happier and more engaged. 

## :pushpin: [Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution?)
--- 

The article talks about ElectOS and development of open source technology to keep elections honest. Most voting systems in use are based around proprietary, black-box hardware and software built on the 1990s technology, and they are vulnerable to attacks. I think it's very nice to have open source project for the voting system. People around the world can either request access to certain code to advance development efforts or contribute on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project).

## :pushpin: Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software?
---
 
I would like to work in a company that only produced open source software. Being open and free, the project itself can be debugged and improved by many developers and users. I believe that the main purpose of building software is to meet customers' needs, and open source makes it happen. Everyone can submit a feature request and contribute in his or her way to make that software better. It's also a great chance to see and learn how other people approach the same issue differently.

#### **:cherry_blossom: April 28, 2020**

Our team had a quick talk on our next step, our deadline, and our next meeting. We also divided the work: Michelle and Shania will work on how to display the data, and ChiShing and I will work on adding data to the database.

#### **:cherry_blossom: April 30, 2020**

I was stuck on how to add seed data to MongoDB database through coding. ChiShing solved it converting the data from js file to json file and added it to the database using MongoDB Compass.
