Why am I Here?

Why did I Decide to Take a Course in Open Source Software?
---

The main reason I chose this course is that it fits my schedule best. I didn't know much about open source software, so learning new knowledge is never a bad thing. When I looked at the course syllabus, I saw many new topics that I had never heard of before. This will give me the opportunity to increase my understanding of software in the real world, not just coding projects. The fact that I haven't had a chance to work as a tech intern, I think this was a great opportunity to learn about how other people contribute to coding or non-coding skills to the real world.
