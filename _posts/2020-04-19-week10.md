On **April 6, 2020**, we had our second guest speaker, **:star: Gil Yehuda :star:**. He's the Senior Director of Technology Strategy from Verizon. Surprising to know that he didn't like the idea of Open Source Software when it first came out, then he changed his perspectives. I've never thought about the downside of FOSS until Gil Yehuda mentioned some points of why many companies were afraid of the Free Software Movement. I forgot the fact that the companies are relying on their software for profits, and a stranger might not be responsible for his or her code if it has a security flaw. :fearful: Like what Professor Weiss mentioned in class, Gil Yehuda also emphasized the fact that it's crucial not to share any code that is work for hire without permission. :scream: Lastly, he told us that it's unnecessary to read the entire code to contribute to an open source project, and it's not essential to learn many different kinds of programming language to get paid for working on open source projects all day. :relaxed:



### :bookmark_tabs: Next.js

:clock10:

Next.js is mainly written in JavaScript, which is a language that I'm not familiar with. With that being said, I looked up couple introduction videos for JavaScript, and I watched a **3.5 hours** [YouTube video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg). It's about all the syntax that a beginner needs to know to get started with the JavaScript programming language. As I was watching the video, I also took notes and did some coding activities. I ended up using **5 hours** to finish the video. :tired_face:

**:heavy_check_mark: Finished watching an introduction video of JavaScript**

As I've mentioned before, my team found a handbook for Next.js, and I finished reading it. However, I think it wasn't that helpful when comes to understanding Next.js in a deeper level.

I thought it might be a great idea to look at those pull requests that were successfully merged on [GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), so I can get some ideas on how other people contributed to the project. I paid most attention on those that only made small changes such as the PR that modified less than 10 lines of code because beyond that I can't really understand what they were writing. Below is a list of successfully merged pull requests that I looked at. Most of them were updating dependencies or replacing unused code. 

1. [Update Custom Server README's #10843](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/10843)
1. [Merged Update introduction.md #11092](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11092)
1. [Merged: Remove react-ssr-prepass alias as it's no longer needed](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11170)
1. [Merged: Update @next/bundle-analyzer dependencies #11068](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11068/files)
1. [Merged: Update emotion dependencies in with-emotion-11 #11414](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11414/files)
1. [Merged: Remove broken link to example api-routes-micro](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11597)
1. [Update hello-world example React version & name for CodeSandbox #11550](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11550)

I have always wanted to add the Next.js handbook link and Next.js Spectrum channel chat link on Next.js README, so I opened a [pull request](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11727). The core contributors responded very quickly as usual. This time my PR didn't get approved, :worried: but I learned many things out of it. First, they shared with me [a curated list of awesome resources: books, videos, articles about using Next.js](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs). Now my team has access to more resources on how to use Next.js. Second, I was told that the Next.js Handbook is not up to date. Lastly, they mentioned that they are no longer using the Spectrum chat channel, and they use GitHub discussions as their main chat community. They wrote these things in the comments under my PR, yet they modified/deleted parts of it. Not sure why they did that.

**:heavy_check_mark: Found more sources on learning Next.js**

**:clock330: Group Meeting**

I shared with my groupmates about the PR that I opened in that morning and the new updates on Next.js such as the discovery of the [resource link](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs). We also talked about the branch protection that we put on the canary branch because it's causing some permission errors. I told my groupmates about my concerns on creating an example as a contribution. It seems a big project to do, I've never used JavaScript in a project, and I'm totally lost on where to start. My teammates are very friendly, and they are willing to help me with it. :relaxed: Shania said I can use her as a resource if I'm lost, and she will use her professor as a resource. :smiley: Michelle then came up with the idea of incorporating MongoDB with Next.js. She also shared some tutorial links for MongoDB for us to get started with it. In case the example contribution doesn't work out, we also looked at some new issues such as ["React server mismatches: Prop `className` did not match. #11600"](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11600). 

#### **:cactus: April 9, 2020**

Michelle opened an [issue](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11756) and asked if we can work on adding an example of a Next.js project using MongoDB. The core contributor approved it.

#### **:cactus: April 11, 2020**

:clock11:

I found some relevant links for Next.js + MongoDB.

1. [MongoDB Crash Course: how to download MongoDB on Windows and how to use basic MongoDB shell commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-56x56UppqQ)
1. [Building Modern Applications with Next.js and MongoDB](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/nextjs-building-modern-applications)
1. [Using a database with Next.js](https://codeconqueror.com/blog/using-a-database-with-next-js)
1. [Using Mongo with Next.js API routes](https://github.com/wbunting/with-mongo-connection)

:clock130:

Those successfully merged pull requests that I looked at gave me some inspirations. Most of them were found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples). Then, I found a tiny error in the hello-world directory and opened a [pull request](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11830). Maybe it was Saturday, or it was during the lunch time, this pull request didn't get reviewed right away. I also watched a video on [how to update npm packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAFY-21UGvE) and made another [pull request](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11833). Both of them were successfully merged around 5PM.

**:heavy_check_mark: Contributed something other than fixing typos or grammar mistakes**

#### **:cactus: April 14, 2020**

:clock630:

My [previous PR for hello-world directory](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11830) was reverted. :worried: I originally opened this PR because I saw that the application name doesn't match the name field in package.json file. Based on the introduction video that I watched, I thought they must be matched. Recently, [someone changed the name from "hello-world" to "nextjs-hello-world" purposely](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11550). I did look at that PR before, but I wasn't sure why he did that beforehand. As a result, I clicked on "Revert" button, which opened a new [PR](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11877). Then I realized that it was already reverted by the core contributor, so I closed it again. With that being said, I learn something new today:

1. PR can be reverted, and it can be done by the person who created it or the core contributor/owner of the project
1. The name of the application doesn't have to match to the name field in package.json
1. A new software called [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
	

### :pushpin: Contribution

On April 6, 2020, I joined a virtual Git workshop, which was conducted by a graduate student in Hunter College. It was a great review for the basic Git commands. I also made couple more contributions on Wikipedia. I found it hard to look for a specific image on Wikimedia Commons, then I realized that I can go to the Chinese edition Wikipedia and click on the images that are on the article. It would direct me to a Wikimedia Commons page, then I can use the image on the English edition Wikipedia article. I also added [some internal links](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fuzhounese_Americans&oldid=949634534) on the article. One thing that's hard when comes to adding internal link is it often shows "This title relates to more than one page". For example, if I inserted an internal link for New York, it can be referred to New York City or New York States. Lastly, I [inserted two external links](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Swarovski&oldid=949637560) as a citation in the paragraph.
