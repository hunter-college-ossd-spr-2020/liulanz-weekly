Comments on the Project Evaluation Activity

Project Evaluation Activity
---

I actually really enjoyed doing the project evaluation activity. My teammates, Caitlin and Elijah, are super friendly, helpful, and welcoming. We were in the same classes for a couple of semesters, yet weâ€™ve never really spoken to each other. This team activity allowed me to start a conversation and network with them. 

The moment I looked at the questions, I thought I wouldn't be able to complete it on time because it requires lots of searching, reading, and writing. Reading and writing in a short amount of time is not my strength. In particular, reading about something that is totally new to me generally requires perusing the material a couple of times. The same goes for writing: I have to phrase my sentences couple times in mind before writing them down. At this point, I was still treating this activity as individual work, then I realized that I have teammates who are here to help me.

During the activity, Elijah was responsible for forking, making a branch, and creating files, while Caitlin and I were responsible for searching and answering questions on Google Docs. When I was stuck on a specific instruction or a question, Caitlin was there to assist me and explain the questions. When Caitlin and I needed help with the development environment question, Elijah said he would take care of that part. Caitlyn is a fast writer, so she completed most of the questions before I got to them. It was a great experience working in a team where we're all helping each other out and finishing the task.


Project

Among the projects that were listed in the wiki, I like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) the most. Gatsby has many clear instructions, links, suggestions, and tutorials that prepare new contributors to become a part of the community. The contributors can raise question or discussion as an issue, and others will respond very quickly by providing related links or images and follow-up questions. People in the community are welcoming and friendly. The maintainers are courteous, thanking the contributor of almost every issue and pull request that has been made. They also sent out invitations and gifts for those who contributed successfully. 

This weekend I also took a look at other projects. My top 3 project choices are:

- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/labels/junior%20job)
- [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/22379)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
